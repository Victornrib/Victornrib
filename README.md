### Hello! I'm Victor.

I really like working with software development to create programs that I enjoy and programs that can create solutions for real-life problems.

Currently I'm a junior software developer with 3 years of experience. I have good experience with languages like Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript. And also many technologies like QT, Android Studio, Blender and others.

Always keen for new projects :)
